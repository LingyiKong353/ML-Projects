# ML-Projects

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! Here, I showcase various projects that explore the exciting world of machine learning.

1. **Email Spam Classifier**: This project aims to develop a robust classifier for identifying spam emails, utilizing various tree-based techniques.
2. **Neural Network Simulation**: Explore the realm of neural networks with this project, where I simulate and examine the workings of these powerful algorithms.
3. **Credit Card Default Classification**: Implement logistic regression, visualize data, and use gradient descent for classifying credit card defaults, while exploring feature mapping, regularization, and model evaluation techniques.

[Stay tuned for updates as I continue to add more projects!]
