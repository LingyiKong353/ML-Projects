# ML-Projects

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! Here, I showcase various projects that explore the exciting world of machine learning.

1. Email Spam Classifier: This project aims to develop a robust classifier for identifying spam emails, utilizing various tree-based techniques.
2. Neural Network Simulation: Explore the realm of neural networks with this project, where I simulate and examine the workings of these powerful algorithms.

[Stay tuned for updates as I continue to add more projects!]
